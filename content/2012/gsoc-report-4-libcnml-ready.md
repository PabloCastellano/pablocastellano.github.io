Title: GSOC Report #4: libcnml ready

Not so many changes but important advances:

-   Libcnml is rewritten and uses classes. Now you can do things like managing a *CNMLLink* object and get the two *CNMLNode* objects
    linked:

> *from libcnml import *  
> c = CNMLParser('tests/detail.3')  
> node = c.getNode(888)  
> print node  
> <libcnml.CNMLNode instance at 0xb75082ac\>  
> dir(node)  
> ['\_\_doc\_\_', '\_\_init\_\_', '\_\_module\_\_', 'addDevice', 'devices', 'getDevices', 'id', 'latitude', 'longitude', 'parse', 'status',
> 'title', 'totalLinks']  
> link = c.getLink(8787)  
> print link  
> <libcnml.CNMLLink instance at 0x8c296cc\>  
> link.getLinkedNodes()  
> [<libcnml.CNMLNode instance at 0x8c29a6c\>, <libcnml.CNMLNode instance at 0x8c294ac\>]

-   Thanks to the new libcnml, unsolclic for AirOSv3 is now working! Other templates are not working, they still need some adaptation.
-   I [fixed a bug](https://gitorious.org/guifi/drupal-guifi/commit/07134ed5f303afa4a69257db64bf222d64dd863f) in the CNML generation in the
    Guifi.net website.  
    It was the typical bug that nobody had ever realized before because there has never been a real use of CNML :-)
-   I had another meeting with Ram√≥n and Roger. We talked about the Optic Fiber specification. This is something that needs to be very well
    though and cannot be finished spending many hours consecutive. So I will continue working in other things and keeping in mind how to
    improve it. Luckily at the end of the summer there will be something good.
-   GUI has now zoom in and zoom out buttons, hehe
