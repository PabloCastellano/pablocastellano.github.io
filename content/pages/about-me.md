The name of this blog is based on the [name of an album](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Inconsciencia_de_Uoho_(álbum)) of the guitarist of
the Spanish band Extremoduro, [Uoho](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iñaki_Antón).

If you have any suggestion, question, you have discovered a bug in this site, you want to offer me a job o you simply want to tell me
something that you think I might be interested, contact me:

You can also find me as "pablog" in FreeNode.

Last, but not least:  
 In this site you will find [Flattr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flattr/) buttons. Flattr is an innovative micropayments system invented by
one of the co-founders of The Pirate Bay and that for sure will revolution the financing system of websites and virtual communities in the
Internet **without using commercials**.  
 It allows you to "share" a monthly amount of money (e.g. 2€) between the contents of all the web pages that you want. You should really try
it!  
 So, if I have written something that you haved liked or that has helped to you, *Flattr me* ;-)
