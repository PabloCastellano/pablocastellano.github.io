Hi. I'm Pablo castellano. I'm 25 years old, live in MÃ¡laga and I am finishing computer engineering. As so, this blog contains a high grade of computer subjects.
Besides that, I spend my time contributing to free software and reading/learning a lot about computer science, security and cryptography.
