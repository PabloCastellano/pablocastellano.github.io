I had been some time thinking about it and finally I have decided to create a repository for **gnome-rss-applet**in github. You can read
more about it in the [wiki](http://wiki.github.com/PabloCastellano/gnome-rss-applet) You can clone the repository typing:

> git clone git://github.com/PabloCastellano/gnome-rss-applet.git

Yarssr is not a huge piece of code and so, I don't think I will find many troubles. I will try to keep writing here how is the development
advancing. My final idea is to distribute it with gnome-applets, taking advantage that now I have an account in git.gnome.org :)
