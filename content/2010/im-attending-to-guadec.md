![](http://www.guadec.org/img/guadec-oranje.png) Yes, I'm finally attending to [GUADEC](http://www.guadec.org/). I was in doubt due my
financial status but I got some responses (more than expected :)) from people through [CouchSurfing](http://www.couchsurfing.org/) that
offered to host me during those days and I have finally decided to buy my flights. I'm very excited about meeting GNOME people :)
