I have just discovered that if you reside in the US, you can get a BSD or a Linux VISA card, so that every time you buy something
[BSDFund](http://bsdfund.org/) and [LinuxFund](http://www.linuxfund.org/) organizations will get some money (I guess some cents) that then
they will spend on funding some Linux/BSD free software projects.

This [Linux Fund](http://www.linuxfund.org/cards/) webpage, says that they are preparing to revitalize their other cards in North America
and launch a card in Europe. Without any doubt, I would get one. Nice idea!

Here are the images:

Cute, aren't they? ;)
