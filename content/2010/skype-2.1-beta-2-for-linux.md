As Skype surprised the open source community two months ago, [recognizing that they were working in a linux open source version of their
client](http://share.skype.com/sites/linux/2009/11/skype_open_source.html), today I found that on 20th January they released a new version
with [a lot of bugfixes](https://developer.skype.com/LinuxSkype) and new features like desktop sharing, support for UI styles (it includes
integration with GTK+!!) and also several PulseAudio bugfixes (I bet I am not the only one who remembers that damn old bug that kept the CPU
at 100%)... Their plans are to release an open source UI to use with a closed source Skype library. I have no complains, open source
community win! It even makes sense to start thinking about skype integrated in [empathy](http://live.gnome.org/Empathy) through
telepathy-skype :) There was already a project to do more or less the same with pidgin, but you had to have skype running, which is not so
beautiful: [skype4pidgin](http://code.google.com/p/skype4pidgin/). http://share.skype.com/sites/linux/2010/01/flowers_become_screens.html
