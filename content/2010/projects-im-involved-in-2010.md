In the last months, thanks to the less work in university I'm having (I'm doing Erasmus), I am getting involved in many free software /
collaborative projects. I'm a bit scared because trying to cover a lot of them will involve also not focusing in any one in particular. I
follow the development of these ones:

-   guifi.net: Telecommunications network open, free and neutral because is built through a [peer to peer
    agreement](http://guifi.net/WCL_EN) where everyone can join the network by providing his connection, and therefore, extending the network
    and gaining connectivity to all. It started in Catalonia, Spain, where has a lot of promotion. Actually, there are also another Spanish
    cities trying to do the same.
-   GNOME: free software desktop environment (I think it doesn't need more explanations)
-   ReactOS: open source operating system intented to be binary compatible with Windows
-   OpenInkPot: free and open-source Linux distribution for eBook reading devices, especially with e-Paper and other high-latency, bi-stable
    screens.
-   Debian: this new year I will prepare myself to be Debian Maintainer.
-   CAcert.org: I'll be a CAcert assurer soon!
