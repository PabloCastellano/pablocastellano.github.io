Title: An attempt to censor my wikileaks mirror?

Hi all. I'm online again.

Last 6 December I decided to host a WikiLeaks mirror in my shared server in order to support them against all the censorship attempts
they've had in the last days. It could be found
at [http://wikileaks.lainconscienciadepablo.net](http://wikileaks.lainconscienciadepablo.net/)

My surprise, yesterday my hosting provider decided to suspend my account. You can read my two tweets about it here:

I've been fully following WikiLeaks news since the day they got DDoSed even before publishing the documents and I haven't read about any
censorship attempt against mirrors. Have I been the first one? And what are their reasons? Is it coming a new [wave of
censorship](http://www.softlayer.com/) attacks against mirrors? Good luck so. 

A SiteGround employee has forwarded my questions to the legal department.  
 I'll keep you up to date. You can follow me on twitter [@_pablog](http://twitter.com/_pablog)

And thanks all for your support.
