Title: smartcard support in gnome-settings-daemon 2.31.1
Date: 2010-5-11
Category: TODO
I have just discovered that Ray Strode, a Red Hat employee, [has added smartcard support to
GSD](http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-settings-daemon/commit/?id=6c87af2623f611de55730fe856c8a5abd3991277).

> This plugin listens for smartcard insertion and removal events and then locks the screen or forces a log out (depending on gconf) when the
> card used for login is removed.

In a post from June 2007 in his blog, [we can read that his team use it for
work](http://blogs.gnome.org/halfline/2007/06/09/smart-card-login/). This is really cool, as this idea had passed by my head sometimes.
