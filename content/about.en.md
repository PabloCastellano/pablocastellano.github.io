I was born in 1989 in Malaga (Spain :es:), where I grew up all my life and studied Computer Engineering. In 2017 I moved to Barcelona and started working as a DevOps at [Adevinta](https://adevinta.com/).

Then I turned 30 and my life changed.

I took up [LibreBOR](https://librebor.me/?mtm_source=pablog) again with the idea of ​​turning it from a Final Degree Project into something more ambitious: an entrepreneurial project. I also started working as a freelancer for other companies.

Since 2021 I have been a digital nomad, I do not have a fixed residence. I usually live most of the year in Spain although I also spend months getting to know other cities around the world.

I am passionate about free software and open knowledge and I have been collaborating on various projects for over 15 years, such as: [Guifi.net](https://guifi.net), OpenWISP, Wikipedia, 15Mpedia, GNOME, aMSN, Debian, Ubuntu, CAcert.org, https-everywhere and [postmarketOS](https://postmarketos.org/).
